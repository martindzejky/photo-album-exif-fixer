# Session End Summary - 2025-09-11

## 🎯 What We Built Today

### **Core App Foundation**

- **SvelteKit + Tailwind**: Modern, responsive UI with proper tooling
- **File System Access API**: Local folder/file handling (Chrome/Edge only)
- **Three-page flow**: Landing → Select Folder → Albums → Album Detail

### **Smart EXIF Analysis Engine**

- **Comprehensive scanning**: Analyzes ALL photos, not just samples
- **Detailed categorization**:
  - ✅ Correct dates (match album)
  - 🟠 Future dates (photo taken after album date) - **KEY ISSUE FOUND**
  - 🟣 Past dates (photo taken before album date)
  - 🟡 Missing EXIF data
- **Visual indicators**: Color-coded borders, detailed breakdowns

### **User Experience Excellence**

- **Beautiful date formatting**: "October 27, 2004" throughout
- **Smart logging**: Auto-scroll toggle, persistent side panel
- **Responsive design**: Auto-fit grids, proper scroll areas
- **Clear status indicators**: Red/yellow/gray borders for quick issue identification

## 🔍 Key Discovery

**The main issue isn't missing EXIF data** - it's photos being placed in albums with dates earlier than when they were actually taken! The app now clearly highlights these "future date" issues.

## 🚀 Next Session Goals

### **EXIF Fixing Implementation**

1. **Preview mode**: Show exactly what changes will be made
2. **Apply changes**: Write DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate, ModifyDate to match album date
3. **Backup system**: Create .bak files before modifications
4. **Verification**: Confirm changes were applied correctly
5. **Detailed logging**: Show exactly what was done

### **Current State**

- ✅ **Analysis phase**: Complete and working beautifully
- 🚧 **Fixing phase**: Ready to implement next session
- 📊 **All data available**: Every photo analyzed and categorized
- 🎨 **UI ready**: Just need to add "Fix" buttons and preview dialogs

## 📦 Project Status

- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **Dependencies**: All installed and working
- **Git**: Clean commits, ready for next phase
- **Performance**: Good (removed heavy thumbnail loading)
- **Browser support**: Chrome/Edge (File System Access API requirement)

Ready to finish the core feature - the actual EXIF fixing! 🔧
